# Data Structures and Programming Methodology
The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with particular emphasis on software and machines from a programmer’s point of view. In CS 61A, students are exposed to a diverse set of mental models for computational problems and solutions through programming paradigms like functional programming, object-oriented programming, and declarative programming. In CS 61BL, students refine those mental representations by focusing particularly on the efficiency of writing programs (design) and running programs (runtime).

## Projects
**Project 0: 2048**

This project replicates the 2048 game, intended as a crash course in Java. 

**Project 1: Deques**

In this project, students work on the implementation of a new abstract data type called a Double Ended Queue (deque, pronounced “deck”) to gain an understanding of the usage of a backing linked list in datastructures and experience using testing and test-driven development to evaluate the correctness of your own datastructures.

**Project 2: Gitlet**

In this project, students implement a version-control system that mimics some of the basic features of the popular system Git. This is smaller and simpler, however. 

**Project 3: CS61BYoW**

In this project, students create an engine for generating explorable worlds. This is a large design project that requires students to work through every stage of development from ideation to presentation as an introduction to software engineering.
